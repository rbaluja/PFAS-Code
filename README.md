PR (pub ready) is the directory for the refactored and cleaned code. PR/infant_health_head.R can be run to reproduce all figures and tables in the paper (I am still working through some small details to make sure all file paths are set up appropriately).  
I also plan to update this README to include a description of each file that needs to be run and the parameters set in infant_health_head.R
